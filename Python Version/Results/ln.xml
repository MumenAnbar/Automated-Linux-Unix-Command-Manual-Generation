<Manuals><ln><Description>       In  the  1st form, create a link to TARGET with the name LINK_NAME.  In
       the 2nd form, create a link to TARGET in the current directory.  In the
       3rd  and  4th  forms, create links to each TARGET in DIRECTORY.  Create
       hard links by default, symbolic links  with  --symbolic.   By  default,
       each  destination  (name  of  new link) should not already exist.  When
       creating hard links, each TARGET must exist.  Symbolic links  can  hold
       arbitrary  text;  if  later resolved, a relative link is interpreted in
       relation to its parent directory.</Description><Version_History>(GNU coreutils) 8.32</Version_History><Example>ln Examples.sh ex.sh
